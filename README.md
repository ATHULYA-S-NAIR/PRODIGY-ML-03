# PRODIGY-ML-03
An SVM-based classifier to distinguish cat and dog images from the Kaggle dataset, using Python for preprocessing and model training.
# Cat vs Dog Image Classification Using SVM

This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset. The goal is to build an accurate classifier by utilizing image processing and feature extraction.

## Features
- Preprocesses image data for efficient feature extraction.
- Trains an SVM model using scikit-learn for binary classification.
- Evaluates the model with performance metrics like accuracy and precision.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Load the dataset and run the script or notebook to preprocess images, train the model, and view results.

## Applications
- Demonstrates the application of SVM in image classification tasks.
- Can be extended to classify other types of images with additional training.
